Publish content in multiple locales.

== Description ==

The Multilocale plugin offers a tiny toolset for publishing content in multiple locales. It is intentionally limited in scope, a custom built theme is a requirement, it does not offer localization of all functionality and will most certainly *break your website* and forever make double rainbows disappear.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `multilocale` folder to your WordPress `plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enable 'multilocale' support for your post types, eg. by using add_post_type_support( 'post', 'multilocale' ) in your functions.php or site-specific plugin
1. Visit the locales setting page to add locales to your site
