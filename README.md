# WordPress Multilocale Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-multilocale.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/barryceelen/wp-multilocale)

The Multilocale plugin is aimed at developers and offers a tiny toolset for publishing content in multiple ~~languages~~ locales. It is intentionally limited in scope, a custom built theme is expected, it does not offer localization of all core functionality and might even **break your website** and forever make ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆdouble rainbows ðŸš«disappear.

Companion plugin: [Multilocale Duplicate Slug](https://github.com/barryceelen/wp-multilocale-duplicate-slug)
